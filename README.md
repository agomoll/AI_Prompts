The following represent examples of using AI to speed up work tasks.


In this first example, I needed to prepare an email message to work colleagues. In this particular case I needed to inform staff members with licenses for one of our enterprise platforms that their licenses would be revoked. Utilizing ChatGPT, I was able to create a prompt that returned a professional message very quickly. 


Prompt:

In this second example, I was tasked with preparing a regular tool tip message to send out to our Tableau developers. In the spirit of providing frequent, short content that users could consume regularly I created this promt.
